Well, this is the 3rd time I started this project, and hopefully the last.

This app was requested for a challenge, the requirements are:
-  To build a simple Carousel mobile application in React Native. 
- Use Expo to develop this application or React Native Client.

I'm using images I've taken during severals adventures with my friends in the Patagonian mountain range (south side of the Andes mountains)
